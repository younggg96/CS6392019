    <string name="instructions">Instructions</string>
    <string name="instructionsContent">Saute broccoli (and onion/garlic if you’re using it) in a tablespoon of oil. After a few minutes, add the coconut milk and let simmer for 5-8 minutes. The broccoli should soften but still be tender-crisp.\n
Add the curry paste to the pan and whisk it until it combines with the coconut milk. Add the chickpeas.\n
Bring to a slight boil and add the cornstarch. Boil for about a minute, then reduce heat and let cool slightly. Sauce will thicken as the mixture cools.\n
    </string>
    <string name="instructionsContent2">Cut the steak into 3 or 4 parts. Pat the steaks dry then season both sides liberally with salt and pepper\n
In a heavy duty skillet large enough for the skirt steak, heat oil over medium-high heat until it’s very hot. Add the steak and sear both sides (brown both sides) for 2-3 minutes until medium rare or cook longer until your desired doneness. I cooked mine for about 4 minutes on each side. Place steaks to rest on a plate and cover with foil.\n
In a skillet melt the butter over low heat then add the garlic. Cook swirling or using a spatula to move the butter and garlic around until lightly golden. Don’t over cook, or the butter and garlic will burn.\n
Pour the garlic butter into a bowl and salt to taste. Slice the steak against the grain. Garnish with parsley and then spoon or pour the garlic butter over the steak. Serve immediately.\n
</string>
    <string name="instructionsContent3">In a large pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the carrots and bell pepper and sauté for 4 - 5 minutes, until slightly softened.
Add the garlic, ginger and curry paste and cook for another minute until fragrant.
Stir in the broth, coconut milk and rice. Increase heat to high and bring mixture to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook for 10 - 15 minutes or until most of the liquid is absorbed and the rice is almost cooked through.
Stir in the shrimp. Cover and cook for about 5 minutes until shrimp is pink and opaque. Stir in the lime juice, sprinkle with cilantro and serve.
</string>
    <string name="instructionsContent4">To a large Dutch oven or stockpot, add the bacon and cook over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes; stir intermittently. Using a slotted spoon, remove bacon from pot and place on paper towels; set aside. Keep the bacon grease in the stockpot. You could drain some off if desired but I didn’t because there are a lot of vegetables that need to sauté in it.

Add the onion, carrots, celery, and sauté for about 7 to 9 minutes, or until vegetables begin to soften. Stir intermittently.
Add the garlic and sauté for another 1 to 2 minutes.
Add the flour and whisk constantly until lightly browned, about 1 minute.
Add the chicken broth, milk, potatoes, thyme, oregano, salt, pepper, optional cayenne, and bring to a boil. Allow chowder to boil fairly rapidly for about 15 minutes or until potatoes are fork-tender; stir intermittently. At any time while the chowder is boiling, if the overall liquid level is lower than you like and the chowder is too thick, adding a cup of extra chicken broth (or milk or water) is okay. At the end you will adjust the seasoning levels.
After potatoes are soft, add the corn, and boil for 1 to 2 minutes to warm the corn through.
Reduce the heat to low, add most of the bacon bits (reserve about 1/4 cup for garnishing), and add the cheese slowly, and stir continuously until melted and combined.
Add the parsley and stir to combine.
Taste chowder and add salt to taste. It will vary based on how salty the brand of chicken broth used is, how salty the bacon and cheese are, and personal preference. Make any necessary seasoning adjustments (i.e. more salt, pepper, herbs, etc.), garnish with bacon and cheese if desired, and serve immediately. Chowder will keep airtight in the fridge for 5 to 7 days; reheat very gently prior to serving so it doesn’t ‘break’. I haven’t tried freezing the chowder.

    <string name="instructionsContent5">Heat the oven to 350. Wash and clean your chicken breasts and then place them in a 9 x 12 glass baking dish. Take the BBQ sauce and a brush and cover the tops of the chicken breasts with the BBQ sauce. Then take the fire roasted tomatoes and cover the chicken breasts as well. Do not drain the tomatoes before, you want the juice and all in the dish. Then grab the green chilies and cover the tops of the chicken breasts. Place in the oven and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven and cover with cheese and green onion tops. Bake for an additional 15 minutes. Allow to cool before serving.

</string>
    <string name="instructionsContent6">ICook the Chile Relleno Boca Essentials patties according to package directions. Chop them into bite-sized pieces.
Mix all of the corn salsa ingredients together in a bowl.
To make the avocado cilantro sauce, puree all of the ingredients in a mini food processor or blender. Adjust seasoning to taste.
Divide the rice among 4 bowls. Top with equal portions of Boca patties, corn salsa, tomato, lettuce and avocado. Drizzle the avocado cilantro sauce on top. Enjoy!
