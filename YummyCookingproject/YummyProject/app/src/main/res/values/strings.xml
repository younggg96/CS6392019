    <string name="instructions">Instructions</string>
    <string name="instructionsContent">Saute broccoli (and onion/garlic if you’re using it) in a tablespoon of oil. After a few minutes, add the coconut milk and let simmer for 5-8 minutes. The broccoli should soften but still be tender-crisp.\n
Add the curry paste to the pan and whisk it until it combines with the coconut milk. Add the chickpeas.\n
Bring to a slight boil and add the cornstarch. Boil for about a minute, then reduce heat and let cool slightly. Sauce will thicken as the mixture cools.\n
    </string>
    <string name="instructionsContent2">Cut the steak into 3 or 4 parts. Pat the steaks dry then season both sides liberally with salt and pepper\n
In a heavy duty skillet large enough for the skirt steak, heat oil over medium-high heat until it’s very hot. Add the steak and sear both sides (brown both sides) for 2-3 minutes until medium rare or cook longer until your desired doneness. I cooked mine for about 4 minutes on each side. Place steaks to rest on a plate and cover with foil.\n
In a skillet melt the butter over low heat then add the garlic. Cook swirling or using a spatula to move the butter and garlic around until lightly golden. Don’t over cook, or the butter and garlic will burn.\n
Pour the garlic butter into a bowl and salt to taste. Slice the steak against the grain. Garnish with parsley and then spoon or pour the garlic butter over the steak. Serve immediately.\n
</string>
    <string name="instructionsContent3">In a large pot, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the carrots and bell pepper and sauté for 4 - 5 minutes, until slightly softened.
Add the garlic, ginger and curry paste and cook for another minute until fragrant.
Stir in the broth, coconut milk and rice. Increase heat to high and bring mixture to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook for 10 - 15 minutes or until most of the liquid is absorbed and the rice is almost cooked through.
Stir in the shrimp. Cover and cook for about 5 minutes until shrimp is pink and opaque. Stir in the lime juice, sprinkle with cilantro and serve.
